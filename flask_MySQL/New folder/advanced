9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
